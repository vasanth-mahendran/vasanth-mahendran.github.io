        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
I'm a software engineer with a passion for crafting seamless e-commerce experiences. Constantly curious, I'm always diving into new technologies and keeping up with the latest tech news. Outside of work, you'll often find me helping friends build custom PCs and NAS setups, combining my love for tinkering with hardware and solving technical challenges. I also love playing outdoor sports with friends and participate in multiple regional sport events, combining my passion for sports with my knack for bringing people together. My fascination with data goes beyond the professional realmâ€”I enjoy finding creative ways to organize and manage data, turning what some might consider a chore into a rewarding hobby.</p>
